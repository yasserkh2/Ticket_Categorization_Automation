Dashboard loading extremely slow on mobile devices
   
Issue #1247
   
Description:
The main dashboard takes 15+ seconds to load on mobile devices, especially on slower connections. This is causing user frustration and increased bounce rates.

Steps to reproduce:
   1. Open the app on a mobile device
   2. Navigate to the dashboard
   3. Observe loading time

Expected behavior: Dashboard should load within 3-5 seconds
Actual behavior: Takes 15+ seconds, sometimes times out

Additional context:
   - Affects iOS Safari and Chrome on Android
   - Desktop version works fine
   - API documentation for the dashboard endpoints is missing, making it hard for new developers to understand the data flow
   - This is blocking our mobile user acquisition goals

Priority: High - affecting user experience and business metrics
